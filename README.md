# RPA_NLP_Campus_Change
This RPA is designed to handle Salesforce cases for applicants requesting a campus transfer within the educational institution. It employs advanced machine learning techniques, including Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Named Entity Recognition (NER), to automatically extract the desired campus from the case description provided by the student. The code can understand various contexts in which such requests may arise and also validates the feasibility of the transfer by checking specific requirements.
